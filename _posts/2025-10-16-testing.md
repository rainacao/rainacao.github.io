The past few days have been a flurry of figuring out how jekyll works and how al-folio uses it to tie everything together. My brain is feeling like it's liquid (pun intended). There's still a learning curve and the more I poke around the more I feel like I'm working with someone else's tools; I feel like I'm working against the grain by loosening a lot more components than building on top of it, but a bit of that's just the nature of wanting to see my own vision realized. What's most important so far is to have my research and art somewhere accessible to show others (such as readers like you!).

I've been working on the site with the cursor app for creating new sections and modifying a large number of markdown front matter rather than writing regex/python scripts (that I default to). It also has trouble connecting the css to the html and I have a hard time fixing its work because the code 1. has incredibly non-specific class/attribute names and 2. contains a lot of repetition. I'm generally a patient prompter but I've scolded it quite a few times already .[^agent-interaction-disclaimer]

What is the point of blogging, even, when the internet is being drowned in AI-produced content? I want to make my own site to be a form of resistance to that. It feels a tiny bit hypocritical to have the skeleton, the backbone, the layout, as something produced by a large language model trained on billions of code that others have created. The resulting [[agent output has a type of veneer]][^veneer] coating to it (everything beveled with box shadows and eased transitions) but it'll do for now. Nevertheless I'll try my best to rework and customize things when I have the time to do so, because there are a lot of things I'd like to tweak.

As I'm coding I keep on thinking about cool things that I'd like to implement. I have a tendency to focus on the details and get lost in the weeds and I'm trying to exercise the skills of pulling myself back. I still want to grasp onto these ideas that are bouncing around, about how interactivity might reveal my experiences to others:
- discoverable annotations for my thoughts that one can mouse over in [my artwork]({{ site.baseurl }}/art/)
- chronological reactions and thoughts in the [books that i've read]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/), like digital marginalia of sorts
- sharing a collection and reflection on snippets of art and writing and research that I find inspiring

I also want to have a place to talk more about things that I create, to make my ideas tangible in some manner. For my art, this means connecting multiple pieces together as overarching projects to show my creative process (this might be more difficult for existing pieces because I haven't made a habit of documentation for art creation...[^art-documenting] but I can always start!)

This website is a work in progress. I recently learned the term of a ["publon", an "_elementary particle of scientific publication_"](https://peterkovesi.com/projects/publons.html) which makes up the smallest divisible unit of research that can be published, as a portmanteau of "publication" and "hadron" from physics.[^hadron] not to start [salami-slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_publishable_unit) my brain or anything but I want to embody this approach for my blog, where my writing has much lower stakes. I want to motivate myself to write small posts and updates in terms of blogons that needn't be a huge effort or commitment, though of course I'd love to create and share longer pieces.[^overcoming-fears] Anyway... I'll keep working on it.

[^agent-interaction-disclaimer]: I know it's not good practice to be talking about model interactions like it's an independent agent. please forgive me in this case... (one only scolds something that is capable of some behavior modification after all; would one scold a bedpost for stubbing one's toe?) there is something cathartic about expressing frustration but I notice maybe in this case I'm searching for some kind of response. when the model is [[trained through RLHF]] to output something apologetic, that [[acknowledgement provides some relief]]. but there's none of that with cursor.ai, for good or for bad.
[^veneer]: Veneer is the closest I can get to describing this effect right now: a superior wood applied to the surface of a lower grade material. In generative AI art it's the warm glow of later DALL-E generations, the glint of studio lighting in glassy eyes, the backlit strands of hair haloing heads. It makes it look more professional but it's only surface level. In models that produce text it's the overuse of the em dash in the OpenAI family and other self-aggrandizing terms [like "pivotal" and "intricate"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02273-8). Wrapping the content in some outer shell to seem more important or professional when it's not really the case nor always needed but difficult to get rid of. I'm still on the hunt for a term that better expresses the plasticky quality of the effect, like saran wrap or a layer of modpodge. the phenomenon feels more tight and constrictive than "veneer" really expresses.
[^hadron]: wouldn't quarks be even smaller? I suppose as much as publons are looked down upon it rolls off the tongue more easily than publark.
[^art-documenting]: the process for me is usually a series of revising and polishing and re-drawing until it clicks, which means there isn't much of a breadcrumb trail but is embedded in time as the canvas evolves. I'd like to expand on this more: how do I capture the joy of seeing a work develop? what can I draw (ha!) from each brush stroke? so many rich interactions are kept in the digital medium compared to the traditional, and I wonder how this can be analyzed.
[^overcoming-fears]: I've felt discouraged from creating by people in positions of power at multiple points in my life. I want this to change. I yearn for the freedom to make and discover on my own terms and pace, which doesn't always seem possible in professional settings, where there are certain deadlines. but I still yearn.
