Nice to meet you! My name is Raina 雨童[^yutong] Cao and this is my workspace. I am an artist and researcher interested in **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Augmented Reality**, and **Generative AI**. I am at heart a creator, in various flavors and combinations of programming, writing, drawing, and occasionally fiber-crafting. 

I'm interested in how artificial intelligence can support human intelligence.

In my free time, I like to read, visit birding spots, and spend time with loved ones.

[^yutong]: 雨 yǔ (rain) + 童 tóng (child). My given name carries the story of my arrival to the world on a rainy night. It also embodies my parents' wish for me to carry a childlike sense of curiosity and wonder throughout my life, which I strive to live up to.
